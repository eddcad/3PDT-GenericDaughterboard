# 3PDT-DBoard

Very basic 3PDT Daughterbard with no LED or CLR. There is a "No-Net" pour on the
board as there is no specific ground to refer to. This arises because the board
is intended to be used in conjuction with other boards I have developed that
include the full circuit with different pad I/Os.
This board is intended to negate the requirement to individually solder all
pads to individual legs on the 3PDT.

Having read this, do with it what you will!

Happy soldering.
