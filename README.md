# 3PDT-DBoard

Very basic 3PDT Daughterbard with no LED or CLR. There is a "No-Net" pour on the
board as there is no specific ground to refer to. This arises because the board
is intended to be used in conjuction with other boards I have developed that
include the full circuit with different pad I/O requirements.

This board is intended to negate the need to individually solder all of the
individual legs on the 3PDT to wires (I'm inheritantly lazy, life is too short
and I have a mind to waste.)

Having read this, do with it what you will!

Happy soldering.
